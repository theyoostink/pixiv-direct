# Pixiv Direct Extension

## Installation Instructions

1. Get the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/theyoostink/pixiv-direct/releases) page and download the `Source code (zip)` from the latest release under Assets. The contents of that zip should have `background.js`, `content.js`, and `manifest.json` at minimum.
2. Open your browser's `Manage Extensions` page. For example, Google Chrome's page is `chrome://extensions/` which you can enter in the Google Chrome address bar.
3. Load the extension by clicking on the `Load unpacked` button on the top left.
4. Select the folder from Step 1 that holds `background.js`, `content.js`, and `manifest.json`.
5. The extension should now be loaded into your browser. Make sure the extension is enabled.
6. Visit Pixiv and click on a link and it will automatically skip through the redirection page for you!
7. You can manage the extension like any other extension. You can disable and remove the extension as needed.
8. To update to the latest version of the extension, remove/delete the extension and repeat the steps starting with Step 1 using the latest version of the code.

## About the Extension

This extension lets you you click on links on pixiv and go directly to the link destination. It bypasses the redirection `jump.php` page by clicking on the link for you.

If you encounter a bug or would like to request changes, please contact Yoostink.

There are currently no plans to publish this extension to the Google Web Store.
